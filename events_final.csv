7200,@mmbs2021 @scoutthehorizon festivals to run equal events physically and virtually but I'm not sure that's entirely plausible because of so many interests involved in terms of distribution.

7211,@StevanNicholas @Meetup People tend to use the attending option as an I’m interested option. It creates an unclear picture of who is actually going to be there.

🔸 set up the event, ppl don’t attend.
🔸 then ppl ask for videos 
🔸 videos are done, ppl want downloads 

Small teams working w/ small budgets and smaller windows of time.

I’m getting notices of meetups shutting down. I see why",1
